                        <h4>
                            Overview
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Catalonia</strong> consists of four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. 
                            The capital and largest city, Barcelona is the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the fifth-most populous urban area in the European Union. It comprises most of the former Principality of Catalonia (with the remainder Roussillon now part of France's Pyrénées-Orientales). 
                            It is bordered by France(Occitanie) and Andorra to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, 
                            and the Spanish autonomous communities of Aragon to the west and Valencia to the south. 
                            The official languages are Catalan, Spanish, and the Aranese dialect of Occitan.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            Climate
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The climate of Catalonia is diverse. The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, 
                            Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa). 
                            The inland part (including the Lleida province and the inner part of Barcelona province) show a mostly Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csa). 
                            The Pyrenean peaks have a continental (Köppen D) or even Alpine climate (Köppen ET) at the highest summits, 
                            while the valleys have a maritime or oceanic climate sub-type (Köppen Cfb).
                            In the Mediterranean area, summers are dry and hot with sea breezes, and the maximum temperature is around 26–31 °C (79–88 °F). 
                            Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. 
                            Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.
                            The inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach 35 °C (95 °F), some days even 40 °C (104 °F). 
                            Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around 14–17 °C (57–63 °F). Fog is not uncommon in valleys and plains; 
                            it can be especially persistent, with freezing drizzle episodes and subzero temperatures during winter, mainly along the Ebro and Segre valleys and in Plain of Vic.

                            Overview
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The main island</strong> was inhabited by Aboriginal peoples for up to 40,000 years before British colonisation.
                            It is thought that Aboriginal Tasmanians became separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 11,700 years ago, 
                            after rising sea levels formed Bass Strait. The island was permanently settled by Europeans in 1803 as 
                            a penal settlement of the British Empire to prevent claims to the land by the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars.
                            The Aboriginal population is estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of British settlement, 
                            but was almost wiped out within 30 years during a period of conflicts with settlers known as the "Black War" and the spread of infectious diseases. 
                            The conflict, which peaked between 1825 and 1831, and led to more than three years of martial law, cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginal people and settlers.

                            Events

                        <p>
                            To foster tourism, the state government encourages or supports several annual events in and around the island. 
                            The best known of these is the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, 
                            starting on Boxing Day in Sydney and usually arriving at Constitution Dock in Hobart around three to four days later, 
                            during the Taste of Tasmania, an annual food and wine festival. Other events include the road rally Targa Tasmania 
                            which attracts rally drivers from around the world and is staged all over the state, over five days. Rural or regional events include Agfest, 
                            a three-day agricultural show held at Carrick (just west of Launceston) in early May and NASA supported TastroFest - Tasmania's Astronomy Festival,held early August in Ulverstone (North West Tasmania). The Royal Hobart Show and Royal Launceston Show are both held in October annually.
                            Music events held in Tasmania include the Falls Festival at Marion Bay (a Victorian event now held in both Victoria and Tasmania on New Year's Eve), 
                            the Festival of Voices, a national celebration of song held each year in Hobart attracting international and national teachers and choirs in the heart of Winter, 
                            MS Fest is a charity music event held in Launceston, to raise money for those with multiple sclerosis. 
                            The Cygnet Folk Festival is one Australia's most iconic folk music festivals and is held in Cygnet in the Huon Valley every year in January,
                            the Tasmanian Lute Festival is an early music event held in different locations in Tasmania every two years. 
                            Recent additions to the state arts events calendar include the 10 Days on the Island arts festival, MONA FOMA, run by David Walsh 
                            and curated by Brian Ritchie and Dark Mofo also run by David Walsh and curated by Leigh Carmichael.
                            The Unconformity is a three-day festival held every two years in Queenstown on the West Coast.
                            Each February in Evandale a penny-farthing championships are held.

                            <strong>Jordan</strong> has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. 
                            Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom. 
                            Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom, the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Rashidun, Umayyad, 
                            and Abbasid Caliphates, and the Ottoman Empire. After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, 
                            the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France.
                            The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then Emir, Abdullah I, 
                            and the emirate became a British protectorate. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan, 
                            but was renamed in 1949 to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War 
                            and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967. Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in 1988, and became the second Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
                            Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation. The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy, 
                            but the king holds wide executive and legislative powers.

                            The tourism sector is considered a cornerstone of the economy and is a large source of employment, hard currency, and economic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan. The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries. 
                            The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence. The most recent blow to the tourism sector was caused by the Arab Spring. Jordan experienced a 70% decrease in the number of tourists from 2010 to 2016. Tourist numbers started to recover as of 2017.
