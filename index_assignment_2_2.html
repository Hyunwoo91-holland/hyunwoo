        <p> 
            Hi, I'm Hyunwoo, form Korea. 
            When I was young,
            the people around me tend to wait for great hopeness with many different reasons, <br>
            but I think endless hopeness without change is most terrible thing I ever experienced.<br>
            I've decided to make my own hope and a even more desirable value <br>
            facing with most horrible, scare, or any thing I wanted to avoid form. <br>
            I won't let my surronding life and conditions handle my life style and my future.<br>
            Yes, so am I a pioneer.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been many other cities all around the world. Austraila, USA, Singapore, Germany and so on.
            However, most memorable place was 'hoek van Holland'in Netherland.
