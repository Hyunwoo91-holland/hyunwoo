                    <p>
                        Keep reading for my 1 day Jeonju itinerary!
                        There are nowhere near as many things to do in Jeonju as there are in Seoul or Busan but is that such a bad thing? Not at all. Jeonju is the antidote to big, busy cities and just what I needed at the time. Here are the best places to visit in Jeonju:
                        Would you believe these are just my side dishes? One of the best things to do in Jeonju is eat bibimbap because it’s the original hometown of the dish.
                        In case you don’t know – bibimbap translates as ‘mixed rice’ and is a tasty mess of egg, veggies, beansprouts, kimchi and pepper sauce. If you’re travelling Korea on a budget, eating this affordable dish is one of the best ways to keep the costs down. If you’re looking to try bibimbap in Jeonju (spoiler – you should), I’d highly recommend Family House. There are plenty of restaurants in Jeonju that serve bibimbap but honestly, you can’t do better than this place.
                        Average travel cost: around 50 Euro per day(case of 3weeks)

                    <p>
                        <strong> The capital city</strong> of the island of Hokkaido, Sapporo is a chilled-out place to visit, with all the trappings of a typical Japanese city. While most people see it as a stop-off point on their way to the island´s delightful mountains and hot springs, the city itself has more than enough to keep guests entertained for a while – with fantastic restaurants, gigantic shopping malls and lively nightlife.
    
                        While people often visit during the summer, when Sapporo has a number of great festivals, the highlight of the year is during the renowned Snow Festival, when hordes of tourists descend upon the city to see the amazing sculptures.                         
                        Average travel cost: around 114 Euro per day

                    <p>
                        <strong> Sigiriya</strong> was designated as a world heritage site in 1982. Sigiriya is famous for its palace ruins on top of a massive 200-meter high rock surrounded by the resections of an extensive network of gardens, reservoirs and other structures.

                        The rock itself is a lava plug left over from an ancient long extinct volcano. It is also renowned for its ancient paintings (frescoes), which are similar to those found at Ajanta Caves in India. It is generally agreed, however, that the Sigiriya Frescoes exhibit a uniquely Sri Lankan style. Sigiriya may have been inhabited through prehistoric times.

                        <strong> Russian tundra </strong>is home to polar bears, seals, gray wolves, and rich birdlife during nesting season. Over the past few decades, ecotourism has become more and more interested in the tundra areas, especially the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve near Krasnoyarsk Krai, where visitors can take a number of environmental routes to explore, try bird-watching, or visit as part of an educational tour.

                        The city of Murmansk, in the Kola Peninsula, not only offers incredible tundra views, but it's also a great place to catch a tour to see the Northern Lights.

                         <strong>The different beaches on Zanzibar</strong>  offer something unique and special. We spent three weeks on the island-hopping around the island
                         in search of the most beautiful beaches on Zanzibar. Yes, some are more beautiful than others, but every single one is wonderful.

                        After all, white sand beaches, turquoise water, and friendly locals almost guarantee all visitors will have a great time. For us, the most beautiful beaches on Zanzibar are Pongwe and Nungwi, while Paje was great for kite surfing, and Kizimkaze was perfect for seclusion.

                        <strong> Greenland</strong> is an established photo tour destination, and in the backcountry around Tasiilaq, the combination of alpine landscapes, ice fjords, the neighboring ice sheet, and small local communities makes this a popular place for adventurous photographers. They tend to use the logistical expertise of Travellodge Greenland and Red House Tasiilaq for small group travel, and the primary season is in August and September when the harsh summer light fades and becomes more manageable.
